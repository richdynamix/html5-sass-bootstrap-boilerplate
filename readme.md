HTML5 SASS Bootstrap Boilerplate
=============

Bootstrap Boilerplate is a mash up framework combining the power and flexibility of Bootstrap form Twitter and HTML5 Mobile Boilerplate. The HTML5 Boilerplate build script has also been added for optimisation. 

The CSS is primarily the Bootstrap CSS rewritten  to SASS for more flexibility with additional mixins and functions for responsive font-sizes.  The main bootstrap and responsive style sheets were combined for modularity. Additionally Eric A. Meyer CSS resets were added with modification.


** Mobile Boilerplate is a professional front-end template that helps you build fast and robust mobile web applications. Spend more time developing and less time reinventing the wheel.

** Bootstrap provides simple and flexible HTML, CSS, and Javascript for popular user interface components and interactions. In other words, it's a front-end toolkit for faster, more beautiful web development. It's created and maintained by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter.

** The build script is a tool that optimizes your code for production use on the web.
